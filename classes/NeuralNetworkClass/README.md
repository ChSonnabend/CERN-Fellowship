# Neural Networks

This is a class containing a fully working set of layers and an automated class for setting up a neural network of (virtually) any type. This class will be used for my master thesis: Fitting the dE/dx distribution of the TPC in the ALICE experiment. 
This will then provide an estimate for corrections to the dE/dx and a possibility to quantify the resolution of the detector


# KDE

Kernel Density Estimation for datasets. This will allow a quantification of the detector resolution and detecting outliers by estimating a probability distribution of the datapoints.
